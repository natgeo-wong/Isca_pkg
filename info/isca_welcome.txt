#
# Isca is framework for the idealized modelling of the global circulation
# of planetary atmospheres at varying levels of complexity and realism.
# This MATLAB package is designed to allow for the resort and compilation
# of Isca model output data for easier analysis.  However, the specific
# needs of the individual will vary for different experiments, and
# therefore this package is only meant as a first step basic analysis of
# various statistics such as mean and standard deviation.
#
# The true purpose of this code lies in file handling of data for different
# model runs for various experiments, and in calculating variables such as
# streamfunctions, momentum fluxes and transient eddies.
#
# The analysis of Isca requires certain MATLAB toolboxes, as listed below:
# - M_Map (see https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html)
# - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (MATLAB)
# - Image Processing Toolbox (MATLAB)
# - Financial Instruments Toolbox (MATLAB)
# - Parallel Computing Toolbox (MATLAB) | Optional
